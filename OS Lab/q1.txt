The second attempt where he solves each answer of the nxn matrix separately is the most efficient and the fastest 
and will result in the fastest result. depending on the pc supporting multithreading it can be used to its fullest

The third attempt where he divides the matrix in two halves will take half the time as first attempt where all the multiplication is
done sequentially.

The first attempt comes last as the multiplication is done synchronously.

Since each multiplication is independant of the other multiplictions attemp 2 is fastest then 3 then 1.
