Ans: SepalWidthCm, SepalLengthCm PetalLengthCm and PetalWidthCm. On the basis of these features the analysis of species was given in he form of histograms, 3d plots, correlations and boxplots etc.
2. Are there any strong correlations between features?
Ans: There is a strong correlation between petalLength and petalwidth of 0.96. There is a strong correlation between
petal length and sepal length of 0.87. Also there is a correlation between petal width and sepal length of 0.82
3. Are there any noticeable differences between the species?
Ans: The species have different petal lengths of standard deviation of 1.76. Iris-setona has significantly larger petal and petal width than others.
